plugging into the future:An Exploration of Electricity Consumption Patterns Using Tableau
Project Description

"Plugging into the Future: An Exploration of Electricity Consumption Patterns using Tableau" is a comprehensive, data-driven initiative designed to analyze electricity usage across regions, time periods, and economic sectors. Leveraging Tableau’s powerful visualization capabilities, this project decodes complex patterns in energy consumption to generate actionable insights for utility providers, policymakers, and eco-conscious consumers.

From time-of-day trends to seasonal surges, the dashboard suite empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions for better energy management, smarter infrastructure, and more sustainable consumption.
